Creating a data set of your choosing of a real-life phenomenon

By Dmitrijs Gavilovskis

Main Objective

Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing
Using numpy.random package complete following tasks:

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.

- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

- Detail the research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook.
